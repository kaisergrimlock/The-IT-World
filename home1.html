<h1><a name="_Toc80624168"></a>Team Profile:</h1>
<p>Due to my Myer-Briggs result identifying myself as a campaigner (ENFP-T), as a team member I usually like to work at my own pace using my own innovation and adaptability. As such, I need a team leader who is highly motivated and has great oversight over his or her team members but would refrain from micromanagement and interfering with what I see as my own role in the project. I also need a team leader who is able to motivate me during the length of the project as I am quite easily demotivated as the allure of the project runs out in the middle of it. I am also very bad at planning as such even though I might want to be a team leader, I usually refrain from such positions as my bad planning skills as well as my inability to stick to those plans would hamper the progress of my teammates. As such, I teamed up with Hoang Anh who had been my teammate during the last semester. She is a highly motivated student who strived to do the best in all projects and could help me stay up to speed when doing this one in the future. She is also very detail-oriented with planning skills far surpassing my own which would help in organizing the project in a logical and effective manner. She is also not very micromanagement-y and thus would not interfere too much in my sphere of things, allowing me to do my tasks the way I think is best. Our language of communication was initially Vietnamese but we changed to English since the last session because of a new Korean student who just joined our group. The prospect of working with a foreigner might make things a bit more difficult due to difficulty in communication as well as differences in time zones (as he is currently in Korea). Despite the initial difficulty, I do not think that these factors will constitute a very big problem as I had been studying in Canada and had worked with many foreigners of many backgrounds before, and thus my experience in the matter should come in handy at this moment.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc80624170"></a>Overview:</h2>
<p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the gaming industry which has been experiencing a high growth rate in the past 3 years has been experiencing two-digit growth. Experts are forecasting that the industry will continue to expand well into the year 2021. The gaming industry has been booming for the past few years due to the many varieties of ways to play and experience games due to newly introduced technologies and techniques. While console and PC gaming also has a great boost during the pandemic, they only constitute a small portion of the gaming industry. The biggest gain is expected to come from mobile gaming with China at the forefront of the mobile industry. Even excluding some of the biggest sales that could be earned in a mobile game (advertisements and in-app purchasing) mobile gaming is expected to grow at a rate of 24% this year. The gaming industry is booming, and it had taken over the other biggest entertainment industry: the movie industry. Thus, investing in this industry and making new products in it is a no-brainer..</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc80624172"></a>Description:</h2>
<p>The game would be as mentioned above a trading card game. The player would play the role of a &ldquo;Commander&rdquo; who controls a group of individuals called &ldquo;Guardians&rdquo;. The &ldquo;Guardians&rdquo; are powerful combat specialists drawn from the history and myths of various cultures and regions. The &ldquo;Guardians&rdquo; would have specific combat roles defined by the game such as &ldquo;Vanguard&rdquo;, &ldquo;Defender&rdquo;, &ldquo;Support&rdquo;, each having their own combat specialties and are useful in different situations. A player can have a certain amount of &ldquo;Guardians&rdquo;. When entering &ldquo;battle&rdquo;, six &ldquo;Guardians&rdquo; could be used at any one time by the player. The player has the responsibility to place their &ldquo;Guardians&rdquo; in a 3x2 grid taking the Guardian&rsquo;s stats and roles in mind to maximize their combat potential. Winning battles would grant the player various rewards, the most important of which is token. Tokens could be used to buy new &ldquo;Guardians&rdquo; to add to the player&rsquo;s roster. More importantly, tokens also double as a cryptocurrency that can be bought and sold on the crypto exchange, allowing players to earn while they play thus make the game more appealing to more people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guardians themselves could be traded in the Guardian Marketplace as NFTs. As well as Guardians other in-game products could also be traded like booster items and various equipment for Guardians. By creating a dedicated blockchain-based trading platform, we could eliminate scammers and third-party trading websites in their entirety. Blockchain in its current form is too secured to be hacked or tampered with.</p>
<p>In order to make the game truly cross-platform, the implementation of cloud gaming is needed. The player thus would only need to buy the game and regardless of hardware, whether they are using a phone or a computer they should be able to play it without any problem. This would also reduce the hardware requirement significantly as the game is not using the player&rsquo;s device&rsquo;s resources and storage space. Since the gameplay is pretty simple with click and drag cross-platform would not face much problem UI/UX wise and the only thing that we really need to apply is a scalable user interface to make the game look better on different devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc80624173"></a>Technologies:</h2>
<p>As mentioned above to maximize player base and sales, the game would need to be able to run on most mobile platforms, which means it must be coded using two program languages: Swift and C# for Apple and Kotlin and Java for Android. Since our game is going to be a 2-D trading-card-based game with comparatively limited graphics, we do not need to use powerful 3-D graphic development tools like Unity. Instead, we could use the much more resource-efficient tool Coco-2DX. Coco-2DX had been used by professional developers to make 2-D card games like Clash of Kings and is compatible with C object language and Swift which, as mentioned above, are two of the primary languages we are going to use to develop our game. For 2-D graphics and FX elements, we could draw them on dedicated drawing tools like Paint Tool Sai before importing them to Coco-2DX. For the deployment of our blockchain for the game, we could use Truffle, a program designed to work with Ethereum blockchain. Since NFT, the most important part of the game is currently only used on the Ethereum system, this tool is pretty much perfect for us. For the cloud aspect of the program, we could use tools like BitTorrent Sync and Rackspace.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc80624174"></a>Skills Required:</h2>
<p>Although it is a bit unrealistic to make a game of this caliber alone as it takes a team of many specialized professionals to successfully develop a game, it must be said that many high selling indie games were created by a very small team of developers and sometimes even by a single very passionate developer. The skills needed for a game developer are vast. Firstly, we need to be well acquainted with the programming language needed to develop the game, in this case, Java, C#, and Swift. Secondly, we need to be able to create 2D graphics in order to make game character sprites, background images as well as UI elements. For this, some art skills are required as well as the ability to understand and utilize user-centered designs. Thirdly we need to know to create and sell NFT and utilize that knowledge in game development. And fourthly we need intimate knowledge of cloud computing and the ability to use it to store game-related databases.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc80624175"></a>Outcome</h2>
<p>If the game is successful on release it would create a whole new gaming experience for players. Players now could turn gaming into a half-time or even full-time job as our blockchain technology would allow them to trade their in game tokens for real money. The game&rsquo;s success would encourage many others to utilize blockchain in game design, after which the advantages of blockchain gaming would be so apparent that other products in the industry would have to utilize this technology or at least mimic some of its features. We would for the first time see players be able own their own in-game assets. Cheats and hacks in gaming, a legacy epidemic, would be cracked down much fiercer as account theft would be almost impossible to attempt. The decentralization nature of blockchain gaming would also be able to propel our game across the strict trade barrier owned by few major developers and would give both our game and other indie game a chance to compete against AAA titles in the industry.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc80624176"></a>IT Technology</h1>
<h2><a name="_Toc80624177"></a>Blockchain</h2>
<h3><a name="_Toc80624178"></a>What is blockchain?</h3>
<p>Blockchain was developed in 1991 by a group of researchers as a method to time-stamp documents so that it&rsquo;s not possible to back-date them or tamper with them. However, as blockchain had not been in the headlines in the past 10 years until today, this technology went by mostly unused. That is until the year 2009 when a mysterious online entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin using this same technology. Digital currency had not been unknown up until that point and many entities both private and the public had attempted to create digital currency ever since computers and the internet become useable but they mostly see no success until Bitcoin become a thing.</p>
<p>The crux of the problem lies with trust. If one day I create a new cryptocurrency, no one would use it because no one could trust it to no have been tampered with or that some hackers wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get into the database and affect the market flow. Blockchain-based cryptocurrency is designed to go around this issue. Most normal databases like SQL, usually have someone in charge of it who would enter in entries to change the data while a blockchain as a decentralized database, as such no one is in charge of the database and no single entity could change it the data from within the system. No extra money could be flushed into the economy and no money could be pulled out with a single click of a button from the person in charge. The people who use Bitcoins run the Bitcoin economy giving them more trust in the system and allowing more people to pay or invest in it. More importantly, however, is that since a blockchain database as mentioned above is effectively immutable it is therefore impossible to fake, hack or double-spend the Bitcoins you have, ensuring the people that use this money that it is a limited resource with some value in it (just like real money).</p>

<h3><a name="_Toc80624180"></a>How Blockchain affect you?</h3>
<p>Blockchain is currently most famous for being the basis which many cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum is being built upon but its advantages as an immutable distributed ledger could be used in much more than that. Currently the newest trends using blockchain technology is NFT (Non fungible tokens), a unique digital asset using blockchain technology to verify its authenticity. NFTs are being auctioned across the world for millions of dollars with many rich individuals and business gurus flocking to invest in it. NFT could be seen as a natural successor to the fine-art-auction marketplace and although the concept of millionaires throwing their money frivolously at obscure concepts might seem foreign to us, the very existence of NFT could change the face of social media forever since tweets now have a specific monetary value placed upon them. Other applications of blockchain include stock exchange, contract validation as well as online voting. Blockchain also have its impact on the entertainment industry as well, and as I have demonstrated above in my dream project, the technology could be used in gaming.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc80624181"></a>Cloud Computing</h2>
<h3><a name="_Toc80624182"></a>What does it do?</h3>
<p>Cloud computing is a delivery on demand computing service &ndash; including servers, storage, database, networking, software, analytics and intelligence &ndash; over the internet (the cloud) to offer faster, more flexible resources. The first thing we need to look at is the cloud itself. The cloud is a term used to describe servers that have access over the internet and the databases and applications that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers over the world, some have been sent into space as satellite the orbits the earth. By using cloud computing, users and companies don&rsquo;t have to manage physical servers themselves or run applications on their own machines. The clouds allow users and companies to access files and applications on almost any devices from practically anywhere with internet connection. This is due to a technology called &ldquo;virtualization&rdquo;. Virtualization allows simulation of &ldquo;virtual machine&rdquo; that behaves like a physical computer with its own hardware and systems but virtual only. Multiple virtual machines can be running simultaneously on a device, thus make much more efficient use of the hardware system. Because of this, cloud providers can offer their services to many more customers at once than they would otherwise with a more traditional system, and they could do so more efficiently which means less cost. Users could thus connect to their cloud providers via interconnected networks no matter what device they are on as the files and applications that they are using are being sandboxed in a virtual machine and is not normally affected by the designs and specs of the user&rsquo;s own device&rsquo;s hardware.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc80624183"></a>What is the likely impact?</h3>
<p>Cloud computing take advantage of economy of scale effect since you typically only pay for the cloud services you are using. This allows you to run your infrastructure more efficiently which in turn lower your operating cost and scale as your business changes, growing or shrinking, as time goes on. Since cloud uses virtualization technology it could help create virtual workplaces whereby applications and services could be hosted by a data center and could be accessed all over the world where the internet it available. Thus cloud computing could increase the ease of working as employees would no longer need to be present at their work station to be able to complete their jobs and more people should be able to work at home thus giving people more time to spend on their families and hobbies.</p>
<p>Allowing students from everywhere to attend classes no matter where they are. Moreover, cloud technology allows students to access technology and resources available at the university through a click of a button. This is becoming ever increasingly useful as the COVID-19 pandemic had forced many to stay at home limited international trade and travels. Cloud technology have also revolutionized the way we view entertainment, movies no longer needed to be downloaded onto our devices to be watched and could instead be streamed through cloud-based apps like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. This could also extend to gaming as Google announced Stadia, a cloud-based gaming application that allows players to play games without even having to download the files onto their computers (as the game are streamed to the computer screen through the cloud like movies).</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc80624184"></a>How will Cloud Computing affect you?</h3>
<p>Cloud computing have, is and will have a profound impact on the lives of everyone. Slowly but surely most online databases will migrate to the Cloud thus many services and application would thus be mostly cloud-based. We are seeing it right now with most smart phones requiring or suggesting users to upload their photos and other data onto the smartphone&rsquo;s cloud accounts for storage. Doing so not only will help users store their data forever but also release crucial storage space on the phone itself. As cloud technology develops the idea of downloading software to be used directly on your computer might disappear forever as all software might be cloud-based and be sandboxed in a remote data center, with only the UI being streamed to your computer screen for you to use. Since virtualization also allows users to access databases and applications everywhere in the world, it will have a great social impact and might change social norms as profoundly as the smartphone and social media did many years ago. As applications could be accessed where internet is available, we could expect more and more people to be allowed to work at home as the need to go to the workplace grows smaller and smaller. People would also no longer need to travel for work as much while companies could hire from a much larger pool of potential employees. This could change the very fabric of society as we know it and may have profound impact on personal and workplace dynamics, though if this is going to have a positive or negative impact on our lives is still up for debate.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc80624185"></a>IT Professionals</h1>
<h2><a name="_Toc80624186"></a>Indie Game Developer</h2>
<p>Gwen Frey <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7msj5k8MY4M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7msj5k8MY4M</a></p>
<p>In this video, Gwen Frey talks about her decision to become an indie game developer. Gwen used to be an artist working for a major company called Slipgate Ironworks, the company closed down after a few years and she ended up jobless. Afterward she worked on &ldquo;Bioshock Infinite&rdquo; a major AAA game title alongside her team at Irrational Games. After the final DLCs were shipped, however, Irrational Games was not able to produce another major title and was forced to close down, making Gwen unemployed once again. Afterward she decided to create her own game studio alongside her former team-mates and other talented people that she knew. Her first game, &ldquo;The Flood and The Blood&rdquo; was unsuccessful at the beginning and Gwen and her team had to struggle to make ends meet. However, the game became more economically viable later on and saved the studio, for Gwen it gave her the experience and the background to go entirely on her own and became a solo game developer. As a single developer she created Kine, a very successful indie game that now existed on all platforms and is currently being sold on the Steam webpage. As a solo game developer, she used the Unreal Engine and the C++ language to make and code her game. Although she used to work with a team of other IT professionals, as a solo game dev she hardly has to interact with anybody since she is the only one working on the project. Of course from experience and my own knowledge in the matter, she probably has to work alongside some people who manage online game stores in order to let her game enter the market.&nbsp; As an indie developer game development happens whenever you have a computer, and in the case of most indie dev this usually takes place in their home. The aspect Gwen found most challenging is the hardship that comes with the turbulent market of game development. As her stories go she had been left unemployed twice in a role before creating her own game and the first of those games had been unsuccessful. The market of gaming always fluctuates, making it hard for someone who wanted a stable job and requires that person to have a lot of passion and love for what they are doing. Another hardship is the high chance of failure in developing a game, most of the time for a game developer things do not go their way, thousands upon thousands of games never saw the light of day and thus Gwen must expect failures in all of her projects. But this did not stop her, because in her own word &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to fail at something that you love&rdquo;.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc80624187"></a>System Engineer</h2>
<p>Oliver Reiter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiI1wrw2W2Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiI1wrw2W2Q</a></p>
<p>Oliver Reiter is a Systems Engineer working at Palo Alto Networks. As a system engineer he works with clients who want to improve their cyber security posture, where he helps them build and architect their cyber security network through looking at various software and firewalls, mostly in a pre-sale manner. Specifically, he starts his work day by talking to clients, designing and architecting solution in a non-sales manner. The people he is working with are diverse in their technical know-how, ranging from cybersecurity engineers who have intimate knowledge about the systems he is proposing to the top brass of those companies who have few technical knowledge and even fewer practical experience on the field. Oliver&rsquo;s job is to align himself in the perspective of these people and explain to them the solutions in a way that they could more easily understand it and thus implement and purchase it. &nbsp;This does not mean that he only has to simplify cybersecurity concepts or avoid jargons but he also has to speak in the business-language. That is to say to clarify the solutions in terms of company&rsquo;s profit, bottom-line and the goals this company or entity want to achieve with their cyber security posture. Oliver also faced many hurdles in his career, and the one he mentioned here in the video involved a big government agency that was unable to integrate one of his company&rsquo;s products due to a roadblock they had. This event was particularly stressful to him and took many days to resolve. For Oliver, this was a powerful lesson that a system engineer&rsquo;s job is more than just working and understanding the technology but rather to use them and integrate them in a creative way. For him not everything will work the way it was intended and many solution proposals and plan will fall through, thus whenever he think of a plan A, Oliver make sure to think of plan B, C and D as well.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc80624188"></a>System Admin</h2>

<p>In this YouTube video the YouTuber who introduced himself as &ldquo;M&rdquo; is going to film a day at his office as an IT professional. M worked as a system admin, which is essentially taking care of and configuring the company&rsquo;s computer servers so that it runs properly. This means that he has to solve issues when they pop up in the company&rsquo;s server system as well as helping fellow employees who have problem accessing the servers either due to a problem in the server itself or just the employee&rsquo;s ignorance. M starts his day talking to his colleagues and figured out that there was a bug in the system, he also admitted to not being able to develop a program since there are too many projects piled on him at the moment. Afterwards he went over to help an employee who could not access the company&rsquo;s server and guided him/her through the process. Then he went to an employee meeting where he and other fellow employees discuss with each other issues in the company&rsquo;s servers and how to resolve them. Here employees and their higher ups worked together to brainstorm and identify issues. M as a system admin also consulted other employees about bugs and identified several issues in the company&rsquo;s server. After the meeting he went to take some food and then return to work on a fix for the issue outlined during the meeting. Although M did not discuss too much about the hardship of being a system admin in this video we could see that he had been thrown lots of issues which piled up and meant that he could not finish some of the projects that he was meant to do. We can also see that a person like M needs to work a lot with other employees to consult and help them fix problems and issues that arises when they are using the server system.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc80624189"></a>DevOps Engineer</h2>
<p>Sosa: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7E9pMHPRts&amp;t=138s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7E9pMHPRts&amp;t=138s</a></p>
<p>Sosa is a Dev Ops engineer living and working in the U.S. As a DevOps engineer, her job is to develop the infrastructure so that her business can release their products to their customers. More specifically she and her team create a list of checks and balances that is consistently improved upon to make sure that the newest version of the app the company planned on releasing is well-tested and if there are any bugs in it that break the app, they&rsquo;d be able to communicate with the development team to fix it before the customers have a chance to experience those bugs and complain. For Sosa, personally, she and her team create their own pipeline product using Java and Python code in order to test, add new features and fix bugs in the company&rsquo;s latest products. Most of her job revolve around making the infrastructure better so that fewer and fewer bugs would get through the internal system and out into the public. Sosa&rsquo;s day start in the morning, working in the Silicon Valley means that she has more time than others before starting her work day. Her work consists mostly of sitting in front of the computer and typing code, sometimes she would note down some of the things that she thinks is important or that she can&rsquo;t get to in the day so that she could bring them up in a meeting or address in another date. Unlike &ldquo;M&rdquo; who works with others for the majority of his work day and only work alone near the end of the day, Sosa works alone for most of her work day and barely meet another person outside lunchtime. All communications are delivered via company&rsquo;s social network and emails. Sosa did not mention any hardship she faced when becoming a DevOps engineer but mentioned that she and her team is currently working on a system to sort developer&rsquo;s codes and improve the efficiency of the infrastructure&rsquo;s pipeline system.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc80624190"></a>Japanese Game Developer</h2>

<p>Masa is a Japanese game developer working for AAA game development company Bandai Namco, the guys who made legends like Tekken. He is being followed around by the YouTuber Paolo de Griezeman who is making a documentary about a day in the life of a game developer in Japan. Unlike the three other professionals who are working in the United States, Masa as a Japanese has a lot less time before his workday starts. He wasn&rsquo;t able to buy breakfast beforehand and starts the day with just a carton of fruit juice for his meal. He starts his day by looking at internal company emails and social media to check for new developments in the company&rsquo;s projects. Masa spent most of his day working, coding for the company&rsquo;s game, interjected by a few meetings and breaks in between. Sometimes he has to talk to his superiors about the company&rsquo;s expenses as bugs, and new features appeared. Work culture in Tokyo is quite different from Silicon Valley, as the people here are less likely to interact with each other through the workday. Japanese workplace cubicles are also less personalized as employees do not decorate their workplace like Americans usually do. The workday, longer than in America as it is, is lengthened by the appearance of several Japanese cultural phenomena. One of which illustrated in the video is when Masa ends his shift, he has to go drink with his boss and colleagues whether American professionals like &ldquo;M&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sosa&rdquo; spent that time for themselves like gaming or working out. Although Masa did not mention any hardship working at Bandai Namco, I personally learned more about the Asian working culture and several hardships that could await me in the future. Namely, Asian etiquette when maintaining a relationship with your boss as well as the high expectations Asian and Japanese companies had for their employees.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc80624191"></a>Feedback:</h1>
<p>This is probably the first time that I received feedback in an assignment since it&rsquo;s pretty hard to ask others to check your work when they probably are struggling trying to get through the same piece of work. Two of my friends have agreed to give me some feedback for this assignment, their comments are highly appreciated and gave me more insights into my project with a different perspective.</p>
<p><u>Hoang Anh: </u></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;I admire the idea of how this project can connect history and players together. However, I think the project should not mix the "Guardians" who are in the different eras, myths, and regions. It is quite weird to display that the god Zeus combat with Tran Hung Dao. Histories should not be overlapped which may cause the wrong perception about history for the players. To tackle this issue, I think the project can divide the world into different worlds where the "Guardians" with the same era can combat together, for example, the Greek World, the Vietnamese Eras.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>For Hoang Anh&rsquo;s feedback, although I do appreciate her concerns I could not agree with her. One of the reasons why the Guardians are supposed to be of different eras, mythologies and regions is so that more players could understand the references and thus more customers could be drawn to the product. To have only one region or era, in my opinion restrict how many people could understand the references or see themselves in the characters. One way to fix this problem is to restrict the &ldquo;Guardians&rdquo; to either the mythological realm or the realistic realm, as it would not be too immersion breaking if two gods fight each other for dominance or earthly warrior fighting one another on the battlefield.</p>
<p><u>Viet Hao</u>:</p>
<p><em>As a gamer myself, I can tell that your game has great potential in the gaming industry.&nbsp; The gameplay looks unique, and the way you brilliantly combine blockchain into a trading card game makes it even more promising. I can feel the urge to spend hours playing the game when it is available. But I want to remind you that when developing a game, especially TCG, you should consider the balance or meta of the game. If a unit is too strong and overshadows every other character, the game will lose the fun, resulting in many gamers' quitting.</em></p>
<p>Balancing as Hao said balancing is an important aspect of a game, especially a trading card game like the one I&rsquo;m trying to make. These games are incredibly prone to bad balancing, and many games of these types were eventually abandoned by the player base because of poor balancing. With these feedbacks in mind I should be able to start my project and not be dragged into pitfalls of my fore-bearers in game designing.</p>
