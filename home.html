The **** would be a ****** ******* card game with combat elements *** limited user ***** that **** ********** technology to ******* the &ldquo;trading&rdquo; experience of *** game. The game would also utilize cloud-gaming ********** in order to make ** transcend user&rsquo;s devices and hardware limitations.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;">Since the start ** *** COVID-19 pandemic, the gaming industry which have **** experiencing high growth-rate in the past 3 years have been experiencing two-digit growth. Experts are forecasting that the industry will ******** ** expand **** **** the year 2021. The gaming industry have been booming for the past few years due to the many variety of ways to play and experience games *** ** ***** introduced ************ and techniques. While console and PC gaming also have a great boost ****** *** pandemic, they only constitute a small portion of *** gaming industry. *** ******* gain is expected to come from mobile gaming with China at the forefront of the ****** industry. Even excluding some of *** biggest ***** that could be earned in a mobile **** (advertisements and in-app purchasing) mobile gaming ** expected to grow at a rate ** 24% this year. The ****** industry is booming, and it had taken over the other biggest entertainment industry: movie industry. Thus, investing in **** industry and making new products in it ** a no brainer.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;">The game would be as mentioned above a trading card game. The ****** would play the **** ** a &ldquo;Commander&rdquo; who control a group of individuals called &ldquo;Guardians&rdquo;. The &ldquo;Guardians&rdquo; *** powerful combat specialists drawn from history and myths of various cultures and regions. The &ldquo;Guardians&rdquo; would have specific combat roles defined by the game such as &ldquo;Vanguard&rdquo;, &ldquo;Defender&rdquo;, &ldquo;Support&rdquo;, each having their own ****** specialties and are ****** in different situation. A player can **** a certain ****** of &ldquo;Guardians&rdquo;. **** entering &ldquo;battle&rdquo;, *** &ldquo;Guardians&rdquo; could be used at any *** time by the player. The player has the responsibility to place their &ldquo;Guardians&rdquo; in a 3x2 grid taking the Guardian&rsquo;s stats and roles in mind to maximize their combat potential. Winning battles would grant the player various rewards, the most important of which is token. ****** could be used to buy new &ldquo;Guardians&rdquo; to *** to the player&rsquo;s roster. More importantly tokens also double ** a cryptocurrency that *** be bought and sold on crypto exchange, allowing ******* to earn while they play thus make the game more appealing ** more people.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;"><img src="https://myfiles.space/user_files/95472_0722e5a152afcdc9/1629698632_ass-2/1629698632_ass-2-1.png" width="624" height="351" alt=""></p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;">Guardians themselves could be traded in the Guardian Marketplace as NFTs. As well as Guardians other in-game products could also be traded like booster items *** ******* equipment *** Guardians. ** creating a dedicated blockchain based ******* platform, ** could eliminate scammers and third party trading websites in its entirety. Blockchain in its current form is too secured to be hacked or tampered.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;">In ***** ** make *** game truly cross-platform the ************** of cloud ****** is needed. The player thus ***** **** need to buy the **** *** ********** of hardware, whether they are using a phone or a computer they should be able to play it ******* any problem. **** would also reduce *** hardware requirement significantly as the game is not ***** player&rsquo;s device&rsquo;s resources and storage space. ***** *** gameplay is pretty simple with click and drag cross platform would not face much problem UI/UX wise and the only thing that we really need to apply is scalable user ********* to make the game look better on different devices.</p>
<h2 style="margin-top:2pt; margin-bottom:0pt; page-break-inside:avoid; page-break-after:avoid; line-height:108%; font-size:13pt;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri Light'; font-weight:normal; color:#2e74b5;">Technologies:</span></h2>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;">As mentioned above to maximize player base and sales, the game would need to be able to run on most mobile platforms, which means it must be coded using two program languages: ***** and C# for Apple and Kotlin and Java for Android. Since *** game is going to be a 2-D trading-card-based game **** comparatively limited graphic, ** do not **** to use powerful 3-D graphic developing tools like Unity. ******* we could use the much more resource efficient tool Coco-2DX. Coco-2DX had been **** by professional developers to **** 2-D card games **** Clash of Kings and is compatible **** C object language and Swift which, as mentioned above, *** two of the primary languages we *** going to use to ******* our game. For 2-D graphics and FX elements, we could draw them on dedicated drawing tools like Paint Tool Sai before ********* them to Coco-2DX. *** the deployment ** our blockchain for the game, we could use Truffle, a program designed ** work with Ethereum blockchain. Since NFT, *** most important part ** the game ** currently only used on Ethereum system, this tool is pretty much perfect for us. For the cloud aspect of the program we could use tools like ********** Sync and Rackspace.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;">&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="margin-top:2pt; margin-bottom:0pt; page-break-inside:avoid; page-break-after:avoid; line-height:108%; font-size:13pt;"><span style="font-family:'Calibri Light'; font-weight:normal; color:#2e74b5;">****** Required:</span></h2>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;">Although it is a *** unrealistic to make a game of this ******* alone as it takes a **** of many specialized professionals to successfully develop a game, ** must be said that **** high ******* indie game were created by a very small team of developers and sometimes even by a single very passionate developer. The skills needed for a game developer is vast. Firstly, we need ** ** well acquainted with the programming language needed to develop the game, in this case Java, C# and Swift. Secondly we need to be able to create 2D graphics in order to make game ********* sprites, background ****** as well as UI elements. For this **** art skills are ******** as well as the ability to understand and utilize user-centered-designs. Thirdly we **** to know ****** and sell NFT *** utilize that ********* ** game development. And fourthly we need intimate knowledge with cloud-computing and the ******* to *** ** ** store game-related databases.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;">If the game is successful on release ** would ****** a whole new ****** experience for players. Players now could turn gaming **** a half-**** or even full-time job as our blockchain technology ***** allow **** ** trade their in game tokens for real money. The game&rsquo;s ******* would encourage many others to ******* blockchain in game design, after which the ********** ** blockchain gaming would ** ** apparent that other products in the industry ***** have ** utilize this technology ** ** least mimic some of its features. We ***** *** the first time see players be able own their *** in-game assets. Cheats and hacks ** gaming, a legacy epidemic, ***** ** cracked down much fiercer as account theft would be almost impossible to attempt. The decentralization nature of blockchain gaming would also be able to ****** our **** ****** the strict ***** barrier owned by *** major developers and would give both our game and other indie game a ****** to compete against AAA ****** in the industry.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;">Blockchain is a decentralized ******** system managed by multiple parties, otherwise called a Distributed Ledger (DLT). A blockchain ** special from other database of **** type in that it is *********** immutable which allows it ** facilitates *** process of recording transactions and ******** assets in a business environment. An asset can ** a tangible object (i.e. land, cars, houses) ** intangible ************ property (i.e. designs, patents, copyrights). Virtually anything could be tracked, managed and traded on a blockchain network.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;">A blockchain system is ********** into chunks of data called block that are connected to each other, hence the name. When data needed to ** stored, such as when a transaction occurred, it is ******** into the data block inside a blockchain. **** block, aside from the data, also ******* two ***** components: the block&rsquo;s own hash code as well as *** **** code of the previous block. With its own hash code, the block can confirm the exact time and sequence of the transaction. With the hash code of the block ****** it, it can also verify the validity of the previous block. Together the many blocks of a blockchain prevent any block from being ******* or a block ***** ******** between two ******** blocks. Each additional block strengthens the verification of the ******** blocks, ***** the contain the hash codes of the ***** before them and the ***** before them ******** *** hash code ** the ***** before that. This ****** the blockchain tamper-evident, making it effectively immutable. **** removes the possibility of a malicious actor tampering with the data as to *********** hack the content of a block in a blockchain, the malicious actor must ****** with every single block in the chain in short ****** of time, an act deemed impossible with today&rsquo;s technology and technical know-how.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;">Blockchain was developed in 1991 by a group of researchers as a method to time-stamp documents so that it&rsquo;s not possible to back-**** them or tamper with them. However, as blockchain had not been in the headlines in the past 10 years until today, this technology went by mostly unused. That is until the **** 2009 when a mysterious online entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin using this same technology. Digital currency had not been unknown up until that point *** many entities **** private and public had attempted to create digital ******** ever since computers and internet become useable but they mostly see no success ***** Bitcoin become a thing.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;">The crux ** the problem lies with trust. If one day I create new cryptocurrency, no one would use it ******* ** one could trust ** to no have been tampered with or that some hackers wouldn&rsquo;t be able to get into the database and affect the market flow. Blockchain based cryptocurrency is designed to go around this issue. **** ****** databases like SQL, ******* have someone in charge of it who would enter ** entries to change the data while a blockchain ** a decentralized database, as such no one ** in charge of *** database and no single entity could change ** the data from within the system. No ***** money could be flushed into the economy and no ***** ***** be pulled out with a ****** click of a button from the person in charge. The people who *** Bitcoins run the Bitcoin economy giving them more trust ** *** system and allowing **** ****** to *** or invest in it. More importantly, however, is that ***** a blockchain ******** as mentioned above is *********** immutable it ** therefore impossible ** fake, hack or double-***** the Bitcoins *** have, ensuring the people that use this money that it is a limited ******** with some value in it (just like **** money).</p>

Currently *** newest trends using ********** technology is NFT (Non fungible tokens), a unique digital ***** using blockchain technology to verify *** authenticity.

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;">Cloud computing is a delivery on ****** computing service &ndash; including servers, storage, database, networking, software, analytics and ************ &ndash; over the ******** (*** cloud) to offer faster, more ******** resources. The first thing we need to look ** is the cloud itself. The cloud is a term used to describe servers that have access over the internet *** the databases and ************ that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers over the world, some **** been sent into space as satellite the orbits the earth. By using ***** computing, users and companies don&rsquo;t **** to ****** physical servers themselves or run applications on their own machines. The clouds allow users *** companies to ****** files and ************ on almost any devices from practically anywhere with ******** connection. This ** due to a technology called &ldquo;virtualization&rdquo;. Virtualization allows simulation of &ldquo;virtual machine&rdquo; that behaves **** a physical computer with its own hardware and systems but virtual only. Multiple virtual machines can be running simultaneously ** a device, **** make much more efficient use of the ******** system. Because of this, cloud providers *** offer their services to **** **** customers at once than they would otherwise with a more traditional system, *** they ***** do so more efficiently which means less cost. Users could thus connect to their cloud providers via interconnected networks ** matter what device they are on as the files and applications that they are using are being sandboxed in a virtual machine and is *** normally affected by the designs and specs of the user&rsquo;s own device&rsquo;s hardware.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;">Cloud computing take advantage ** economy of scale effect since you typically only pay *** the cloud services you are using.

Since cloud uses virtualization technology it could **** ****** virtual workplaces whereby applications and services could be hosted by a data center *** could be accessed *** over the world where the internet it available. Thus ***** computing could increase *** **** ** working as employees would no longer need to be ******* at their work station to be able to complete their **** and **** people should ** able to work ** home thus ****** people more time to spend on their families and hobbies.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:8pt; text-align:justify; line-height:108%; font-size:12pt;">Allowing students from everywhere to attend classes no matter where **** are. Moreover, cloud ********** allows students to access technology and resources available at the university through a click of a button. This is becoming ever increasingly useful as *** COVID-19 ******** had forced many to stay at home limited international trade and travels. ***** technology **** also revolutionized the way ** view entertainment, movies no longer needed to be downloaded onto our devices to be watched and could instead ** streamed through cloud-based apps like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu.
